# Local DB for local dev

This package runs the dependencies and the dev command to run a local SQLite database, useful for local development and generating migrations.

It's using [Turso](https://docs.turso.tech/cli/introduction), and will automatically run if you run the dev command in the root of the monorepo.

## You never need to do anything directly in this app!
